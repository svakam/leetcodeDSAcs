# LeetCode DSA

Contains a library of my completed leetcode problems and a .NET Core Console App (in progress) to run them. 

If for whatever reason you'd like to run the console app, download the .zip, extract, navigate to the path ".../RunConsole/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1", and run the "RunConsole" .exe there.
